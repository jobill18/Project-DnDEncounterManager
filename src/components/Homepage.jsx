        This is the D&D Encounter Manager, a tool for dungeon masters to plan
        their encounters ahead of time and view the most important information
        about the creatures involved. There are a few encounters that have been
        premade and by creating an account, you can create your own encounters
        and choose which monsters to include. Happy adventuring!
