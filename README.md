DnD Encounter Manager

This app is designed to hold planned monster encounters for a DnD 5e campaign.
It allows a user to choose monsters from the DnD API and group them together in an encounter.
They can then use the tools to make attacks, roll for damage, make skill checks and saving throws, and manage monster hp.
This app is made with the intention of streamlining the planning and execution of combat encounters for Dungeon Masters. It allows rolls to be made in advance and several encounters to be stored for any unexpected combat or planning ahead.
Some premade encounters are included for ease of use or inspiration for your next encounter.
